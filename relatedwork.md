We also took some inspiration from the Nintendo DS game: “The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning” which had a minigame similar to our game, rotation in this version was locked to 90-degree intervals and on a set grid.

Another inspiration for us was the Portal series from Valve. Aesthetics and gameplay were both influenced by these games as we wanted to achieve a similar overgrown sci-fi theme in the game.
